            <h2>Mole Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Moles need to eat constantly. If this animal is deprived of food, in 15-16 hours it will most likely die of hunger.</li>
                <li> To dig a meter-long tunnel, a mole takes about 3-5 minutes, depending on the ground.</li>
                <li> In the USSR, moles were actively hunted because of their skins. At least several million of these animals were exterminated each year.</li>
                <li>The coat of these animals is notable for the fact that dirt practically does not stick to it, even wet.</li>
